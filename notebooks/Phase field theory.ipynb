    "Many problems in physics and mechanics involve finding extrema, either local minima or maxima. This could relate to identifying the maximum or minimum values of a scalar function, where the techniques of differential calculus, such as taking derivatives, are employed. Alternatively, it may involve finding a function that minimizes or maximizes a certain path or integral. In this latter case, the calculus of variations and the use of variational derivatives are essential tools. These concepts form the basis for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena and are central to fields such as classical mechanics and phase field modeling\n",
